/** The programming language Java is a language that is to be understood by
 *  computers and humans. Computers translate programs into a low-level
 *  language which they can understand (by an interpreter or by a compiler),
 *  humans into something that is meaningful to them.
 *
 *  If somebody reads somebody else's code (or even their own code
 *  after a while) then they may have problems to understand it. 
 *  What is done in the program? Why is it done? How is it done?
 *  When will it work and when not? Does it come with a Best-Before date?
 *  Who owns the copyright? Where may it be applied and where not?
 *  All this can be written in the program as comments.
 *
 *  In order to facilitate the readability WE ALWAYS WRITE COMMENTS FOR
 *  PROGRAMS. Comments are any text that is ignored by the computer
 *  when executing the program.
 *
 *  In Java, everything between an opening / followed by a
 *  * and the ending * followed by a / is a comment.
 *
 *  Everything between an opening / followed by two * just as in this
 *  comment is considered by JavaDoc.

// Likewise everything from a double slash to the end of the line is
