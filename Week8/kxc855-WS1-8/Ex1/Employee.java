/** 
 *  Employee is an abstract class that implements Payable, that is, we
 *  have to give an implementation of the methods getPaymentAmount()
 *  and dueDate(). However, since Employee is an abstract class (unlike the
 *  corresponding class from week 5), it suffices to give abstract
 *  methods, we assume the dueDate() to be concrete (the 15th of every
 *  month), but the method getPaymentAmount() to be abstract, which
 *  would be determined differently for the sub-classes of hourly paid
 *  employees and monthly paid employees.  Likewise since Employee
 *  also implements Holiday we have to give an implementation of
 *  getHolidays(). In this case we choose to give a concrete
 *  implementation in the abstract class Employee.
